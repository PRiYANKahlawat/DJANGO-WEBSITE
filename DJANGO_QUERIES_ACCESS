1.  HOW TO USE QUERIES USING DJANGO ORM 
    we can see all the objects/entries 
    write: "python manage.py shell" 
    by  this we can use all the models,etc we made .
    
    "from HOME_first_app import Contact" we will import the model we want to see

2.  HOW TO VIEW ALL OBJECTS ?-->
    "Contact.objects.all()"
    O/P= all the objects we created

3.  to see 1st or any other contact-
    "Contact.objects.all()[0]"
    O/P=we will get first contact

4.  to see an specific field    inside my model-
    "Contact.objects.all()[2].email
    O/P= we will get the email of that contact

5. HOT TO FILTER OUR SEARCH? FOR  EX IF WE WANT TO GET ONLY THE  QUERIES WITH specific NAME-
    "Contact.objects.filter(name='name')"

6.to change a entry,after changing always save it

  ins = Contact.objects.filter(name='name',phone='1254..')[0]

  ins.phone='000000'

  ins.save()
